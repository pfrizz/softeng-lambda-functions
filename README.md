# softeng-lambda-functions
For CS3733 (Software Engineering) our team had to design and build a mock ticket purchasing website in about 6 weeks using React, AWS, and a MySQL database. I was mostly responsible for managing the backend of this project, and these are some of the Lambda functions I wrote that were invoked by a REST API using API Gateway. I also maintained the documentation shared within our team for our entire API, with a brief description of each endpoint and the fields in the body of its request and response as well as sample requests and responses for each endpoint. Documentation wasn't a required part of this assignment, but we usually couldn't all work together at the same time due to different class schedules so it played a big role in helping development go smoothly.
